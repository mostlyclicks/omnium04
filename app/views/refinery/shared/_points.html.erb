<h3>Points and Scoring</h3>
<p>Riders are welcome to participate in one event, two, or all three as points scored in each event accumulate toward the Omnium Championship. Points will be awarded in the individual races based on your order of finish and place in the individual race. Those points will be totaled to determine the overall Omnium Champion. Prizes will also be awarded for individual races and by race categories. USA Cycling sanctions the La Crosse Omnium.</p>
